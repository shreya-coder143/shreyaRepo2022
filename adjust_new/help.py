We\u2019ve fixed some bugs and enhanced the performance of the app.<br><br>If you\u2019ve enjoyed shopping on Shopee, please leave us a review. Thanks!", "comments": ["The shopping experience within the Shopee platform has been great. The products are mostly authentic, and the refund options are actually really convenient. But when it comes to the app's performance, there is a lot of room for much needed improvements. The data usage is really high, and scrolling through photos and shops is really slow. The app also randomly freezes.", "The app is good for the most part. However, one thing that irks me is the occasional bug here and there that make it frustrating to use the app - having to restart the app or clear data to revert the bug. For one, after tremendous effort on my review, I suddenly could not post it due to a \"Server Error\". This is annoying and I have to restart and retype my review from scratch. Sort this issue out!", "I still like ordering from shopee. However, their recent update is disappointing. In the past you can have two vouchers when checking out. The free shipping and cash back. But now, they become greedy and will only let you choose either of the vouchers. I also don't like how they assign the couriers instead of the sellers assigning it themselves.", "This is my most used online shopping app because it's user friendly as the interface is very straight forward. However, I would like to suggest that you have a separate survey or rating option for courier so they'll know how happy or frustrated we are with them. Even though the chat support is very accomodating it still hassle to always contact them everytime your courier is unsatisfactory.", "An easy to use, easy to understand app. The items listed here are generally cheaper than other apps' listings. One thing I would want to see is an improvement of their cart: in that they keep out-of-stock items in the same group/shop it came from, rather than dragging it to the very bottom mixed with other out-of-stock items from other shops. I add a lot of stuff to cart, most goes out-of-stock quickly. Having to scroll through hundreds just to see which ones run out is quite annoying.", "Most of the time, the sellers don't use actual photos of the item and uses a different picture which is why when you get your order, they look different. I know that there's differences on the item but using editing tools/using different pictures to make your items look good is so misleading and waiting people's time and money. I think you guys should add a feature that detects that kind of problem to avoid scams and misleading items.", "I'm not sure if this is a bug or if it's intentional, but I can't seem to use ShopeePay even if it matches the order total (after discounts). The free shipping and discount vouchers are a bit misleading too. There's actually a cap on the amount you can redeem. I also noticed this recently that you can't stack your vouchers anymore. Which is a shame cause it's what actually made me switch to Shopee before. At this point, it seems more economical to buy the products you want on the physical stores", "Shopee as an app used to be good. The deals were also good. But recently it's just been disappointing. Most especially since they removed the stacking of vouchers. On the technical aspect, it's really annoying how you can't use the back button. You can only go back to a previous page by using the in-app back button which is very inconvenient.", "The 2021 version is the most preferred one. Very disappointing in removing other courier when ordering in Shopee Mall. We can't pick what courier we want. It should be okay if the shipping fee is much cheaper than other couriers, but is not. The other thing is the vouchers. We want to pick 2 vouchers at the same time. Please bring back that feature. It's very frustrating to order online nowadays because of this. Lazada is much cheaper and better for now. (2)", "Very deceitful. Do not use Spaylater especially if you are issued a temporary credit limit. You will think that you can pay it in installments, but you will be billed right after you use it. It is not even in the terms and conditions in availing temporary credit limits. They will just tell you to use it before it expires, but charge you in full later. Its a clear misrepresentation for customers to get that credit and they can charge and earn interest while customers end up frustrated.", "I used to be happy making purchases in shoppee before but with the recent updates wherein there's only one option to choose for vouchers(either shipping and discounts) is most disapponting about it and one more thing, you can only select one courier now unlike before. I think switching to other shopping app(Lazada) is one of the most great thing to do right now.", "There are lots I dislike about the new version of this app. First, you can only use one voucher at a time. Which is not good, because you can only choose one between shipping discount or cashback voucher. Second, being a platinum member doesn't really a good thing. I mean, you'll be giving free shipping voucher right but it's with 400minimum order. I mean, hello. you're only forcing the costumer to order that cost. Atleast change for the better, not for the worst!", "First of all the bad experience! You will be given a free shipping voucher that you will not be able to use! For example, with a 1 peso deal, your shipping fee is more expensive than what you bought! \ud83d\uddffGive us a sensible voucher that we can use on any product at any price! Second, there's bugs in the app. Third, It's hard to load a picture even though we have strong internet connection! Please fix it so that we don't have any difficulty using this app. \ud83d\uddff", "Everything is good since I have been using it for 3 years already. But it would be better if you can add a feature where we can add 2 contact numbers in our order incase the other number is unreachable, the other one can be used as a backup. Because today, my sim card was disabled, and I can't receive any calls or texts. So the courier driver can't contact me, and I don't know who to call to get my parcel because their is no name or number of the rider in the shopee tracking page.", "I was able to buy good and lower priced cat food, toys, casual clothes from Shopee. The one time, I was unfortunate enough to transact with a scammer seller, I was advised well by the customer service on not 'clicking order received' and my funds were refunded after two weeks. They corrected the confusion of having to click 'order received' before you can request for a return and refund. Recently, they have added a notification that clicking it will transfer funds to the seller which lessens", "I just want to update my review of this app which is very easy to use and very helpful (not because it is covid pandemic) in general. There are so many benefits especially if the membership is upgraded. Most of the sellers are proactive and ready to rectify any problems occured in a transaction if theres any (as per experiences). The products are very nice and made of high quality materials. Thanks Shopee.", "Disappointing that instead of progressing, it's taking a nosedive. Can't use more than 1 voucher anymore and now there's an admin fee. I also used to be able to cash in any amount desired, now there's a min amt., sometimes you don't really feel like your platinum status makes any difference. I loved shopee due to it being affordable and easy to navigate but now, it feels like you're buying at a regular mall.", "Hi! I am very satisfied to the new system of shoppee which is that I can finally get to re-schedule my pick ups directly at the shoppee app. Which I had violations before because I accidentally clicked schedule for pick up that's why I ended up just canceling the order. And also I can change my pick up address too there. I've always been happy using this app as a buyer and recently a seller. I still want to have the shoppeepay system before where the exact amount is stated and ready to to\ud83d\ude42", "this app is no longer small time business / seller friendly with all the fees. there are numerous bugs be it on games, listing/updating products, uploading images and so on. also its morphing into something where everyones opinion about the changes of this app doesn't even matter. i miss the good ol times in 2019", "Easy to use when buying items but such a hassle when submitting honest reviews of the product because of the repeated text/symbols prompt. You might want to update that because I still see spam and non-related reviews on some items. Also, I didn't like that we can no longer use 2 vouchers at the same time. I am actually considering to use other online shopping apps because of that.", "App poorly optimized. Maybe a change of developer is in order. It often crashes, slow to load and the frequent pop ups aren't what the customers want. Considering that convenience is the selling point of online shopping, the fact that the app isn't as easy to use as against the competitor despite the years you've been operating is disappointing.", "Shopee was once a good app where you can buy things online at the very comforts of your own home but now it is so much better to purchase your items in the physical store near you. The shipping costs extremely high and if you're an old member, they wouldn't let you use any more vouchers. It always has to be 'with a minimum purchase of 500' and etc. The price ain't customer friendly anymore. Also, I miss the old version where you can use two different vouchers at the same time. Fix this", "Misleading free shipping fee vouchers. Couriers still have fees. Do not mislead users ffs. Misleading prices during sales. Items are marked up then discount percentage applied which makes it look like it's discounted. But in actuality the price is more or less what the value was before it was marked up. Pricing history should be added to avoid these scummy practice.", "Recently, the app hasn't been functioning well for me and I always get error in my cart, in my purchases, when searching products, etc. It's like I don't have internet but in other devices it works fine? I have tried restarting, re-downloading, but it's still faulty. I think other ppl are experiencing this too so please address this", "At first the services was superb, one of the reason why I chose this app. Easy to rate, lot's or voucher and no fee at all. But recently update was soo disappointing. Everything change. From difficulty to rate due to lots of prohibited like no repeating words and etc. Vouchers, that before can used 2 at the same time, free sf and other discounts to only 1 voucher. And to have a 1% fee in every cash in you make to shopee pay from gcash. Not happy at all. Will definitely ship to other app.", "I do not know if there's a bug or glitch. Whenever I press an item, it'd say \u201cthis feature is not available at the moment\u201d all the time. This happens a lot when I am searching an item since yesterday. Please fix this. EDIT: The glitches/bugs are gone and fixed, and the update gave me a smooth, fast experience. I could now pay via Shopeepay with ease and had no trouble pressing items.", "I used to be able to use two vouchers in one order, but now I can't. I let it slide because the free shipping voucher was more important, but now that you've charged us a 1% admin fee for the e wallet cash in, I can't. Really? I use Shopee Pay to save money, but now you're charging us more. What is the purpose or advantage of shopeepay? Now, I'm going to go with cash on delivery or another platform because they have a lot more options than you and don't charge cash ins.", "The experience is completely good but one thing here is that your API is not working with phones. Whenever you press the back button on any devices, it's not working. Good thing you have a back button at the application itself. Hope you can fix it for a better UX.", "This used to be a great app, very convenient, easy to use, and easy to understand. But lately, I'm getting disappointed about the changes made by the app. There's already an admin fee when using shopee pay, you can't used to vouchers at the same time. It's really disappointing. Bring back the old shopee!!!! \ud83d\ude20", "Adding features that we're not aware of since they don't give notifications. We just recently found out that they had some changes with their app. Adding ADMIN FEE and removing the feature that WE CAN USE 2 VOUCHERS AT THE SAME TIME (free shipping + another voucher) This is a huge impact for its users, as if they don't care about their customer's experience. It seems that I'll lessen using the shopee because of this. Thanks.", "I just have some issues regarding setting up my address because it cannot detect my right address and can't confirm it with the app. I contacted the customer service but they can't fix my issue. Also, I hope this app will have a change item feature aside from the return/refund so that the buyer can request for a change item without the need to return or refund it.", "I was happy using this app because of the vouchers that can be applied on your orders. Before you can apply two vouchers, like free shipping and cash back, in one order but now you can only choose one. So disappointed and dissatisfied. Hoping that it will be the same like before. Shopee, make us a happy and satisfied customer!", "This is an edited review. I am about to check-out items from my cart yet I got disappointed by the recent update wherein buyers can no longer use free shipping and coin/discount vouchers at the same time. I am a big fan of Shopee but now its getting more vivid that they are competing with the recent events. Very disappointing. By the way, I cancelled all my plans regarding checking out.", "I like browsing in shopee and i feel satisfied even just adding some things to cart ^^ but the app will always freeze when i spend too much browsing or if I'm rating an order, even when I'm playing the games on the app. I don't understand why but this is my problem with the app. Kindly fix this. This is annoying. Sometimes it kicks me out of the app also, so i have to re-open the app again. Edit: recent update sucks. I can't use two vouchers at the same time like I used to.", "Customer service is not as efficient as before. Concerns are not really addressed in a quick manner. Most of my concerns are not directly solved. As an affliate, the payment is also delayed. There are prizes being offered here and there for advertising but they can't provide efficient and fast payment system for some of their affliates. Their update also disabled stacking of vouchers when checking out items, it's disappointing. Shopee used to be a great app, please fix your customer service.", "This is used to be a great app and a great place to buy as they offer almost everything. But now, it is getting worse. It started with cutting down much of the daily coin rewards which they did months or years ago. Right now, you can't use both the shipping voucher and coin voucher. I don't know what Shopee is trying to do with this move. Instead of improving and upgrading their services, they do the opposite.", "Used to be able to stack multiple platform vouchers, but now it's very limited. Also, they started charging a lot of miscellaneous fees to buyers and sellers such as admin fees, cash in fees, etc. Customer support is also not reliable, and there are still a lot of stores with false advertisement and Shopee isn't doing anything about it even after several reports.", "I'm quite happy for they're improving their customer service! It's just that the app is quite slow to respond when you tap a button. And also I would like to suggest to add a feature where you can organize your likes just like Pinterest. I feel like I could be buying more if that were the case since I won't have to keep scrolling to find what I want to buy. But tysm for you efforts, Shopee! Keep improving! <3333", "App is improving yes but along with it is the changes that it's really annoying for the user, you can only use 1 voucher on every purchase which before you can use 2, admin fee for cash in like every transaction you make has admin fee. LESS to NO voucher. Customer service with no offers if you experience any problem, with all the changes I can say that it has no benefits at all to the consumer. You might want to improve it.", "Customer service is so so .. Had a case with them, had to go through DTI just for them to resolve it with urgency only to find out that my items were lost. Waited for almost a month, take note, my order was during the holiday season so imagine the stress I experienced. It doesn't matter whether you're silver, gold or platinum. I'm already a platinum member but I keep on getting bad service from them and no compensation for the inconvenience at all; they don't care. Think twice before ordering."], "appId": "com.shopee.ph", "url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shopee.ph&hl=en&gl=us", "category": "SHOPPING"}}
